1. Permutational non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (PerManova).
The method is implemented in Matlab according to description in: Anderson, M. J. A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance. Austral Ecol. 26, 32â€“46 (2001).
Permutations are substituted with Bootstraps of input sequences (***to do upload script***)

Scripts include:
a. main script - create bootstraps, call main functions, calculate p-value (***to do upload script***)
b. F calculaton with distance matrix input
c. F calculation with sequence input and distances between all character pairs defined by second input matrix

Usage example:
